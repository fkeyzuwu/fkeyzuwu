- 👋 Hi, I’m @fkeyzuwu
- 👀 I’m a self taught indie game dev, working in Unity with C#, and Godot with both GDScript and C#.
- 🌱 I'm also learning C++ and high level math in order to be able to upgrade my game dev abilities, as well as audio programming.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on games or work at a game dev studio
- 📫 You can reach me on twitter @fkeyz
